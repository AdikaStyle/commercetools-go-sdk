0.1.0 (2020-07-07)
==================
First versioned release. Although this library has been in development for
nearly 2 years (first commit 2018-06-18) it never was properly tagged since we
only used it for our commercetools provider.

The codebase is currently fairly stable so this is a good moment to actually
create a tag and start properly updating the changelog.

Note that althrough all the types (structs) should be up-to-date (autogenerated)
some servics might not be implemented yet.

For now atleast the following services are implemented:
   - API clients
   - Carts
   - Cart discounts
   - Categories
   - Channels
   - Custom objects
   - Customers
   - Customer groups
   - Discount codes
   - Extensions
   - Inventory
   - Messages
   - Orders
   - Payments
   - Products
   - Product discounts
   - Product types
   - Project
   - Reviews
   - Shipping methods
   - Shopping lists
   - State machines
   - Stores
